-- Simple Win32 .WAV Player --
------------------------------
------------------------------
	
This project is just a simple Win32 .WAV player in a console application that uses DirectSound to play an audio file. The purpose of it was to make a simple .WAV player thats easy to setup, use and thats freely available to anyone. It also works for x64 compilation if desired.

The .WAV file that comes with the project is a personal file and requires my permission for usage in anything beyond this example project, please contact the email below for more info.

Direct Sound example from Windows SDK Samples that I repurposed for easier use.

--License for this project can be in the project directory under the file "LICENSE" and also in the dsound folder included with the project--

If the DirectX libraries do not exist you may need to install in the Windows SDK to build!
